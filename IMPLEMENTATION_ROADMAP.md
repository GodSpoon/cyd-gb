# Implementation Roadmap

## Week 1: Core Emulator
- [ ] Day 1-2: CPU implementation (clean, optimized)
- [ ] Day 3-4: PPU with direct framebuffer
- [ ] Day 5-6: Memory management and cartridge
- [ ] Day 7: Integration and testing

## Week 2: Platform & UI  
- [ ] Day 1-2: Direct display implementation
- [ ] Day 3-4: Touch input and controls
- [ ] Day 5-6: Simple menu system
- [ ] Day 7: SD card ROM loading

## Week 3: Optimization
- [ ] Day 1-2: Profile and optimize CPU
- [ ] Day 3-4: Optimize PPU rendering
- [ ] Day 5-6: Memory access optimization
- [ ] Day 7: Frame timing and sync

## Week 4: Polish
- [ ] Day 1-2: Save states
- [ ] Day 3-4: Settings persistence
- [ ] Day 5-6: Final optimizations
- [ ] Day 7: Testing and bug fixes

## Key Optimizations
1. Use lookup tables for CPU opcodes
2. Inline memory access functions
3. Static framebuffer allocation
4. Direct SPI writes where possible
5. Compiler optimizations (-O3)
6. Remove virtual functions in hot paths
